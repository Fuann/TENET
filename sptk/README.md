Python scripts (work with python 3.6+) for speech enhancement integrated with kaldi, which could be used dependently.

1. Supervised beamformer/Speech separation based on TF-mask
2. Data convertion among MATLAB, Numpy and kaldi
3. Data visualization (TF-mask, spatial/spectral features...)
4. Data and IO handlers for kaldi's scripts, archives, wave, spectrogram, numpy's ndarray...
5. Faster CGMM trainer
6. Spatial/Spectral feature computation
7. AuxIVA, GWPE, FB
8. Mask computation (iam, irm, ibm, psm, crm)
9. RIR simulation (1D/2D arrays)
10. TF spectral masking, oracle speech separation
11. Si-SDR/SDR/WER evaluation
12. Pywebrtc vad wrapper
13. ...
