## TENET: A Time-reversal Enhancement Network for noise-robust ASR

This is a PyTorch implementation of our paper: [TENET: A Time-reversal Enhancement Network for noise-robust ASR (ASRU 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01531).
  
Audio samples can be found from [here](https://fuann.github.io/TENET).

**--- Source codes and the pretrained model will be released soon ---**
